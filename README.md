"Maze" is a Unity project that I developed. It includes custom animations and sound
effects, as well as a database to store player progress. Ray tracing was used to enhance
the visual quality and to detect collisions when the player interacts with objects in the
game. Additionally, it utilizes a database to store user information and game statistics. The
game is also accompanied by music effects that complement the gameplay experience.
